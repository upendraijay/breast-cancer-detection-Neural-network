IntroductionÂ¶
Data Set Features are computed from image of breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.

Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:

-a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter) 
-b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values) 
-c) perimeter 
-d) area 
-e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths) 
-f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0) 
-g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour) 
-h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour) 
-i) symmetry 
-j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
The label associated with each cell contains the letter "M" if it is the Malignant tumor(cancer) and "B" if it is Benign tumor(Normal).
